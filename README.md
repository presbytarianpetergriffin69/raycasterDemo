## NOTE: I WILL NOT BE UPDATING THIS PROJECT AFTER I COMMIT IT!!! This is simply a demo program that I made to test my knowledge of C and SDL.

A simple raycaster engine reminiscient of the one found in Wolfenstein 3d. Inspiration was taken from https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html here. You will need SDL to build this project.
